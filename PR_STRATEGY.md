# Pull Request Strategy - Contribution Guide

## Making Your PR More Likely to be Accepted

### 1. Start Small
Instead of one big PR with everything, consider splitting:
- **PR #1**: Just the `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` fix (universal Linux fix)
- **PR #2**: Port configuration flexibility 
- **PR #3**: Documentation/Troubleshooting guide
- **PR #4**: Restart policies

Smaller PRs are:
- Easier to review
- Less threatening to maintainers
- Can be merged independently

### 2. Make it Non-Breaking
```yaml
# Instead of changing defaults, ADD options:
ports:
  - "${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}:8181"  # Defaults to original
```

### 3. Focus on the "Why"
In your PR description:
- ❌ "I changed the ports because they conflicted with mine"
- ✅ "Adds port configuration flexibility for users running multiple services"

### 4. Provide Evidence
- Screenshots of the error and fix
- "Tested on Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 39, Debian 12"
- "Fixes issues reported by 5+ users in discussions"

### 5. Make Their Life Easy
- Follow their code style exactly
- Add to existing docs rather than creating new ones
- Provide clear test instructions
- Offer to maintain the feature

## Dealing with Difficult Feedback

### Common Responses and How to Handle

**"This is too complex"**
> "I understand. Would you prefer a simpler approach where we just document the manual fix in the troubleshooting guide?"

**"This breaks existing setups"**
> "The changes are fully backward compatible. Existing users see no change, while users with conflicts can now configure ports."

**"We don't need this"**
> "No problem! I'll maintain it in my fork for users who need it. Feel free to close if it doesn't align with the project direction."

**Rude comments**
> Just don't engage. Either:
> - Address only the technical points
> - Say "Thanks for the feedback" and move on
> - Let the maintainer handle it

## Your Contribution Options

### Option 1: Full PR (You tried this)
Submit everything and see what happens

### Option 2: Incremental PRs
Start with the absolute minimum fix:
```yaml
# Just this one line fixes Linux:
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

### Option 3: Documentation PR
Sometimes it's easier to get docs merged:
- "Added Linux Deployment Guide"
- "Added Troubleshooting Section"
- Put your fixes in the docs!

### Option 4: Fork & Publicize
- Maintain your own "Archon-Linux-Ready" fork
- Add a good README
- People will find it when they have issues
- Original maintainer might eventually pull your changes

### Option 5: Discussions/Wiki
Some projects are more open to:
- Wiki contributions
- Discussion solutions
- Gists linked from issues

## Template for Diplomatic PR

```markdown
## Description
This PR adds configuration flexibility to support deployment in diverse environments.

## Problem
Users deploying Archon alongside other services encounter port conflicts and network connectivity issues, particularly on Linux systems. See issues #X, #Y, and discussions #Z.

## Solution
- Adds environment variable support for port configuration
- Fixes host.docker.internal resolution on Linux
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility

## Testing
- ✅ Default configuration unchanged
- ✅ Tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian
- ✅ Tested with existing Supabase installations
- ✅ No breaking changes

## Documentation
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Updated .env.example with clear comments
- Added Linux-specific deployment notes

Happy to adjust the approach based on maintainer preferences!
```

## If PR is Rejected

You still win because:
1. **You have a working system** with override protection
2. **You helped the community** - Your issue documents the solution
3. **You learned** about the codebase and Docker
4. **You can help others** directly in discussions

## Remember

- Your solution is GOOD and helps real users
- Not every PR gets merged, even great ones
- Some maintainers are overwhelmed, not rude
- Your fork might become the go-to for Linux users
- The override system means you're never blocked
